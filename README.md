TankerPop: TinkerPop v3 + Docker Compose
========================================

Off-the-shelf graph database laboratory
---------------------------------------

At the moment TankerPop includes...

 * [Gremlin Server](http://www.tinkerpop.com/docs/3.0.0.M6/#gremlin-server)
 * [Gremlin Console](http://www.tinkerpop.com/docs/3.0.0.M6/#gremlin-console)

...but the following features may be built soon:

 * Automatic [Gephi plugin support](http://www.tinkerpop.com/docs/3.0.0.M6/#gephi-plugin) for interactive graph visualization
 * Support for [JavaScript Gremlin queries](http://www.tinkerpop.com/docs/3.0.0.M6/#_connecting_via_rest) in the REST API (using the Nashon ScriptEngine)
 * Clojure-based Gremlin script runtime and REPL
 * TankerpopTest, a Gremlin server designed for test suites
 * Benchmarking tools for testing performance of queries
 * Full Neo4j compatibility
 * Web-based Gremlin REPL with D3-based viewer
 * Titanium+Clojure base image

If you'd like to work on any of these, post an Issue and let's talk about it.

Setting up Docker
-----------------

This project, at the moment, assumes you know how to use Docker and Docker Compose. If you use Mac OS X, it's recommended you use [the Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).

All images are based on `library/clojure` (which is a descendant of `library/java`).


Starting Gremlin Console with Gremlin Server
--------------------------------------------

Once you start the Gremlin `console` container, you will need to issue a command to connect it to the other `server` container started by Docker Compose. You do that by loading a config file by its file path. The `gremlin-console/conf` directory contains the example config files that come with Gremlin Console. `remote.yaml`, `remote-objects.yaml` and `remote-secure.yaml` have had the hosts they connect to changed from "localhost" to "server", the host that's created by Docker itself in the container's `/etc/hosts` file.

To start the console and connect it to the server:

    $ docker-compose run console
    Jan 31, 2016 3:14:40 AM java.util.prefs.FileSystemPreferences$1 run
    INFO: Created user preferences directory.

             \,,,/
             (o o)
    -----oOOo-(3)-oOOo-----
    plugin activated: tinkerpop.server
    plugin activated: tinkerpop.utilities
    plugin activated: tinkerpop.tinkergraph
    gremlin> // This is the Gremlin console. Let's connect it to the server now:
    gremlin> :remote connect tinkerpop.server conf/remote.yaml
    WARN  org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.Client  - Could not initialize connection pool for Host{address=server/172.17.0.3:8182, hostUri=ws://server:8182/gremlin} - will try later
    ==>Connected - server/172.17.0.3:8182
    gremlin>


The REPL is a Groovy-based console but the `:remote` command is an instruction to the Gremlin console
directly, bypassing the Groovy interpreter. This command connects your console to the server.

Now you're ready to start tinkering!

    gremlin> graph = TinkerFactory.createModern()
    ==>tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]
    gremlin> g = graph.traversal()
    ==>graphtraversalsource[tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:14], standard]
    gremlin> g.V().values("name")
    ==>marko
    ==>vadas
    ==>lop
    ==>josh
    ==>ripple
    ==>peter
    gremlin>
